# Assessment

Programing Assessment

  For this project i used WSL with an Ubuntu (master) and Oracle VM VirtualBox also with Ubuntu image (target)

Instructions :

  1. Clone Repo locally
  2. Run ansible-playbook situated at: ~/Assessment/app
          - ansible-playbook docker-playbook.yml -i inventory.yaml ( can try with --check first )
  3. RDP into target machine to check container 
          - docker ps
  
  
For quick demo i have attached a desktop recording with steps to start ToDo application.
